# TheOdinProject: Rock-Paper-Scissors
3rd task assigned by TheOdinProject.

# Project Description

1. First is to code the classic game of rock-paper-scissors with the output showing in the console panel. An input is received with the `prompt` function from the player and is checked against a random number that corresponds to rock, paper or scissors. The winner of the round and current score is printed in the console panel. A game consists of 5 rounds and after 5 rounds, the winner of the game is also once again printed in the console panel. This rendition of the game can be found in the `main` branch.

2. With JavaScript,`buttons` take on the role of the `prompt` input function and the output is now printed on the webpage itself instead of the console panel. A combat log now prints the player's selection, computer's selection and the result of the round. A scoreboard updates and keeps track of the scores after each round. Similarly, after 5 rounds, the user is notfied whether they have won or lost the game. This rendition of the game can be found in the `rps-ui` branch.

# Live Preview

# Future Implementations

- [ ] Add animations to victory screen
